5. Recipient creates presentation (loop repeats)

**Optimization:**
- Watermark placement (visible but not intrusive)
- Click-through rate: 5% target
- Attribution link with UTM tracking
- Conversion landing page

**Metrics:**
- Virality coefficient: >0.5
- Share rate: 30% of users
- Viral conversion rate: 10%
- Loop velocity: 2 days

---

#### Loop 2: Template Sharing Loop

**Trigger:** User shares template

**Flow:**
